# AI Fluency Assessment Results - Change Log

## [Phase 1] - Root Cause Analysis - 2025-06-16

### Added
- Created TODO.md with systematic analysis and fix plan
- Established documentation framework for issue tracking
- Set up structured approach for methodological problem solving
- Created plan-fix-visual-layout-inconsistencies.md with detailed visual issue analysis
- Created plan-fix-data-calculation-errors.md with comprehensive data flow analysis
- Created plan-fix-component-architecture-issues.md with architecture improvement plan

### Analysis Completed
- **Visual & Layout Issues**: Identified inconsistent spacing, typography, color usage, and responsive design problems
- **Data Calculation Errors**: Found category score transformation issues, tier determination problems, and user answer generation inconsistencies
- **Component Architecture**: Discovered oversized components, mixed responsibilities, and poor separation of concerns

### Key Findings
1. **Critical Issues**: Data calculation inconsistencies affecting accuracy of displayed results
2. **High Priority**: Visual layout problems impacting user experience and professional appearance
3. **Medium Priority**: Component architecture issues affecting maintainability and scalability

### Next Steps
- Begin Phase 2 implementation starting with critical data calculation fixes
- Address visual inconsistencies in parallel
- Plan component refactoring for improved maintainability

## Change Log Format
Each entry should include:
- **Added**: New features or files
- **Changed**: Modifications to existing functionality
- **Fixed**: Bug fixes and issue resolutions
- **Removed**: Deleted code or features
- **Analysis**: Investigation findings and root cause discoveries

---

## Future Entries
Each fix will be documented here with:
1. Issue identified
2. Root cause analysis
3. Solution implemented
4. Testing results
5. Impact assessment

## Analysis Summary
The root cause analysis has revealed three main categories of issues:

1. **Data Integrity Issues** (Critical Priority)
   - Category score calculations are inconsistent
   - Tier determination logic has flaws
   - User answer generation creates unrealistic patterns
   - Transformation logic applies artificial adjustments

2. **Visual Consistency Issues** (High Priority)
   - Inconsistent spacing and typography across components
   - Mixed color palette usage
   - Responsive design gaps
   - Component alignment problems

3. **Architecture Quality Issues** (Medium Priority)
   - Components exceed maintainable size limits
   - Mixed responsibilities within single files
   - Poor separation of concerns
   - Tight coupling between components

The systematic approach will address these in order of impact on user experience and data accuracy.
